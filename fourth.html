This is the fourth git file I tried to commit and modify.
git init => intialize your folder/directory to git
git status => allows us to check the status of the folder/directory
git add
git commit -m 'first message'
git checkoutcommit_id
connecting to the remote repository
pushing to remote respository
creating different branches
